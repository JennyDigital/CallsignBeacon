# Generates a morse code of your chosen text.

Just change the text and re-compile.  I may amend this project to support a more modern PIC and use EEPROM and a serial port terminal for configuration in the future.



Presently, there are a number of constants in morse.c that set the speed and weightings of the morse transmission.  To tailor the morse characteristics, this is where you look.



Best wishes,
